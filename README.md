# mongodbproj1
Implement a program that helps to learn MongoDB as an example of a document-oriented NOSQL system

When you execute the python code, following files will be generated:

project.json: The data to be stored in project document collections is formed and is stored in file named project.json
employee.json: The data to be stored in employee document collections is formed and is stored in file named employee.json
dept.json: The document DEPARTMENTS JSON that includes information for each DEPARTMENT object (document)
employee.xml: When you fetch data from employee collection, the output in XML format is stored in this file
project.xml: When you fetch data from project collection and write the output in XML format is stored in this file
(We have stored these same files in the output-files folder)


The (Item 4)query output is shown in the console itself.
We executed the Mongo queries using python. 

For the XML task:
The XML is printed on the console as well as written to the respective XML files.

For the JSON/XML task:
We created the department in JSON and it is stored in dept.json
